        Welcome Simon! We are forgoing intros in the meeting, Wendy set up an intros page for us on GitHub here:  https://github.com/w3c-cg/atag/discussions/3
        Simon Jones, Studio 24:👍🏻
        
2025-11-21 09:17:36 From Noemí Fernández to Everyone:
For me, it is ok with AI as a complement to our human minuting!
        
2025-11-21 09:18:50 From Soren Hamby (they/them) to Everyone:
I’m fine with human notes or recording that stays in group
        
2025-11-21 09:19:41 From Lisa Liskovoi to Everyone:
I would love to save our full Zoom transcripts for reference if possible

No - I’m OK with it
        
2025-11-21 09:21:36 From Hidde de Vries to Everyone:
light opposition, it's still “AI” doing that
        
2025-11-21 09:21:44 From Mike Masey to Everyone:
No problem here
        
2025-11-21 09:21:52 From Hidde de Vries to Everyone:
with same risk of misrepresentation. So we should definitely manually check

        Simon Jones, Studio 24:👍🏻
        
2025-11-21 09:22:19 From Staniland, Laura to Everyone:
As a woman in STEM classes, I was often put in the role of secretary during group exercises. Nowadays, I do all I can to avoid being the minutes taker/organizer/administrative person for group activities.

background reading for all:
        Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Overview
        https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/
        
2025-11-21 09:25:54 From Mike Gifford (CivicActions) to Everyone:
I would also think that we should touch on what we can do to make ATAG easier to adopt. Uptake has been poor I believe as there hasn’t been demand from clients.
        Soren Hamby (they/them), Lisa Liskovoi:➕
        Simon Jones, Studio 24, Noemí Fernández:💯
        
2025-11-21 09:28:41 From Soren Hamby (they/them) to Everyone:
One question I get is about mobile authoring apps and apps that host UGC that allow authoring or editing (eg social media) and I’d love to discuss what devices are in scope more plainly for readers.
        
2025-11-21 09:31:52 From Charles Hall to Everyone:
Modern content management tools also have layers (rule sets, business logic, authoring, APIs, environments, etc), as well as admin rights (super user, admin, author, editor, etc.) so making the authoring tool accessible is FAR different than ATAG anticipated. We need to account for all roles and endpoints.
        Mike Masey, Soren Hamby (they/them):💯
        
2025-11-21 09:33:44 From Jutta Treviranus to Everyone:
Replying to "I would also think that we should touch on what we...":
Agree! There were authoring tools that implemented, showing it wasn’t so difficult, but of course there was powerful resistance to implementing by influential parties. Unlike WCAG, implementing also wasn’t supported by a burgeoning industry to check and repair Web sites.
        
2025-11-21 09:34:15 From Mike Gifford (CivicActions) to Everyone:
But what are the incentives for the makers of authoring tools to invest in making the authoring interface adopt ATAG?
        
2025-11-21 09:37:55 From Simon Jones, Studio 24 to Everyone:
Replying to "But what are the incentives for the makers of auth...":
Increased users. Some of our clients like RNIB have staff who have accessibility needs so this. has become a big criteria for them when choosing a CMS. We all have access needs as we grow older too..
        Soren Hamby (they/them):❤️
        
2025-11-21 09:38:02 From Charles Hall to Everyone:
Perhaps we start with an updated definition of an authoring tool?
        Staniland, Laura, Soren Hamby (they/them), Björn Fisseler:👍
        Wendy Reid:💯

2025-11-21 09:39:47 From Jutta Treviranus to Everyone:
In the last version of ATAG we considered user created content separately.
        
2025-11-21 09:40:06 From Lisa Liskovoi to Everyone:
Replying to "But what are the incentives for the makers of auth...":
I think this is why the policy piece is key. There are of course many benefits to having tools be accessible, but without policies and regulations there will likely be limitations to adoption.
        
2025-11-21 09:40:48 From Jutta Treviranus to Everyone:
Replying to "In the last version of ATAG we considered user cre...":
such as social media posts. But this has changed significantly.
        
2025-11-21 09:41:27 From Wendy Reid to Everyone:
Replying to "In the last version of ATAG we considered user cre...":
I think what tools are capable of now is the biggest change from 2.0, we have more power to enable people to make accessible content!
        
2025-11-21 09:41:55 From Mike Gifford (CivicActions) to Everyone:
@Staniland, Laura consider asking for https://acreditor.section508.gov/  rather than a VPAT (which is generally an inaccessible PDF).
        
2025-11-21 09:41:56 From Hidde de Vries to Everyone:
Great angle, Laura!
        
2025-11-21 09:41:56 From Soren Hamby (they/them) to Everyone:
Replying to "In the last version of ATAG we considered user cre...":
Now it feels like many social media apps for mobile are authoring tools with a social posting endpoint
        Wendy Reid:💯
        
2025-11-21 09:42:43 From Mike Gifford (CivicActions) to Everyone:
Also useful to see the Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Toolkit
         https://www.educause.edu/higher-education-community-vendor-assessment-toolkit
        
2025-11-21 09:43:54 From Charles Hall to Everyone:
It is fair to say the world has changed dramatically and not just the technology
        Soren Hamby (they/them), Mike Gifford (CivicActions), Noemí Fernández, Staniland, Laura, Wendy Reid:➕
        
2025-11-21 09:46:26 From Staniland, Laura to Everyone:
Replying to "Great angle, Laura!":
        Thank you!
        
2025-11-21 09:46:59 From EJ Mason to Everyone:
Apologies, everyone. Some trouble with my router :/
        
2025-11-21 09:47:01 From jason morneau-peate to Everyone:
Sure has, we have a client (I worked in Fintech as a qa manager) who is in the world of loans in general and a request they have was #1 using AI #2 Accessibility standards and authoring tools and #3 combining both and the challenge there is huge and even lead us to review all qa processes
        
2025-11-21 09:49:13 From jason morneau-peate to Everyone:
Think of GitHub as an old forum board from 2004
        
2025-11-21 09:49:15 From Sarven Capadisli <https://csarven.ca/#i> to Everyone:
How does authoring content via GitHub measure wrt following ATAG? =)
        Charles Hall, Soren Hamby (they/them):😂
        
2025-11-21 09:49:36 From Wendy Reid to Everyone:
Replying to "How does authoring content via GitHub measure wrt ...":
Guess we’ll find out 😂
        
2025-11-21 09:49:45 From Mike Gifford (CivicActions) to Everyone:
Replying to "How does authoring content via GitHub measure wrt ...":
Definitely something to push at https://accessibility.github.com/
        
2025-11-21 09:49:57 From Sarven Capadisli <https://csarven.ca/#i> to Everyone:
How about using... authoring tools... to author content related to ATAG =)

2025-11-21 09:51:15 From jason morneau-peate to Everyone:
This is a great start!
        
2025-11-21 09:51:21 From Jutta Treviranus to Everyone:
One systemically-motivated B to B reason for adoption is the demand by companies who are currently relying on accessibility evaluation and repair companies wanting to adopt an authoring tool that will allow them to reduce that reliance or dependence.

2025-11-21 09:52:27 From Hidde de Vries to Everyone:
excited this group is starting!
        
2025-11-21 09:52:30 From Mike Masey to Everyone:

Thanks - this has been good, I’m looking forward to contributing 🙂
        
2025-11-21 09:54:09 From Charles Hall to Everyone:
I believe ATAG should focus more on the humans that need to and get to participate in the creation of content using any tool to do so via any input modality. it would be nice to have the structure focus primarily on the human needs versus the type of tool and its interfaces.
